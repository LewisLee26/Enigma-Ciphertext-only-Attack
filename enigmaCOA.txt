I will have a program that, for a given input text, will input it into an enigma machine and guess the settings.
Then it will give the output from the enigma machine to an AI that will take text as an input and then output a number from 1 to 0 (1 is shakespeare, 0 is cipher text). 
The program will repeat inputing the text into the engima machine and then giving the output to the AI.

This works because the closer the settings are on the enigma machine the more real text/shakespeare there will be in the output.
It will need a lot of text as input (over 200 characters).


For the training I can have two classes, encrypted and decrypted text. Each will class be a single text file. I could just feed one text file into a enigma machine and then use that as the encrypted text but im not sure whether that will create any problems.
